  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={The challenges to ensure safe and trusted communication of information between various organizations have increased multifold in recent past. Intrusion Detection Systems such as firewall, message encryption and other approaches are being employed with partial success, however the risks and chances of malicious intrusions are still posing a threat. We are proposing to make use of recent advancements in the field of machine learning to develop an intrusion detection system. In our work, the machine learning classifiers namely, random forest, decision table, multi-layer perceptron and naive bayes were used in an ensemble model showing a significant improvement in the overall accuracy. The proposed approach was implemented using a bench-marking dataset from KDDCup.},
