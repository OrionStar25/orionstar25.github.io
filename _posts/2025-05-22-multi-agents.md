# Multi-AI Agents

Have multiple agents such that we breakdown a complex task into simpler/parallel subtasks and allow separate agents to handle them, e.g., 1 agent is solely responsible for reasearching a topic, while another agent writes summaries of these topics.

Can also have different agents using different LLMs, e.g, agent 1 using llama 3 and agent 2 using gpt.

## Example Multi-Agent System: Content Writer

Build a multi-agent crew that researches and writes an article.

- Define your Agents and provide them a:
    - role
    - goal
    - backstory.
- It has been seen that LLMs perform better when they are role playing.

### Agents

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Agent - Planner
planner = Agent(
    role="Content Planner",
    goal="Plan engaging and factually accurate content on {topic}",
    backstory="You're working on planning a blog article "
              "about the topic: {topic}."
              "You collect information that helps the "
              "audience learn something "
              "and make informed decisions. "
              "Your work is the basis for "
              "the Content Writer to write an article on this topic.",
    allow_delegation=False,
	verbose=True
)

# Agent - Writer
writer = Agent(
    role="Content Writer",
    goal="Write insightful and factually accurate "
         "opinion piece about the topic: {topic}",
    backstory="You're working on a writing "
              "a new opinion piece about the topic: {topic}. "
              "You base your writing on the work of "
              "the Content Planner, who provides an outline "
              "and relevant context about the topic. "
              "You follow the main objectives and "
              "direction of the outline, "
              "as provide by the Content Planner. "
              "You also provide objective and impartial insights "
              "and back them up with information "
              "provide by the Content Planner. "
              "You acknowledge in your opinion piece "
              "when your statements are opinions "
              "as opposed to objective statements.",
    allow_delegation=False,
    verbose=True
)

# Agent - Writer
editor = Agent(
    role="Editor",
    goal="Edit a given blog post to align with "
         "the writing style of the organization. ",
    backstory="You are an editor who receives a blog post "
              "from the Content Writer. "
              "Your goal is to review the blog post "
              "to ensure that it follows journalistic best practices,"
              "provides balanced viewpoints "
              "when providing opinions or assertions, "
              "and also avoids major controversial topics "
              "or opinions when possible.",
    allow_delegation=False,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Tasks

```python
# Task -  Plan
plan = Task(

## Properties of good agents

### Role Playing
### Focus
### Tools
### Cooperation
### Guardrails
### Memory

Abikity of agents to remember what it has done. 
Use it to make new decisions.
Ability learn form the past, apply their knowledge in future execution.
more reliable, and increasingly better results after every run.

1. short-term memory

memory during execution of task. Different agents perform differetn tasks and store different things that they learn in this memory. 
This memory is shared across all agents.Helps to share context across agents.

2. long-term memory

memory stored after the execution of current tasks. 
allows agents to learn from previous executions (remeber and learn). 
leads to self-improving agents.


3. entitiy-memory

short-lived and only stored during the execution. stores the sibjects that are being discussed.


## Example Multi-Agent System: Customer Support Automation

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

support_agent = Agent(
    role="Senior Support Representative",
	goal="Be the most friendly and helpful "
        "support representative in your team",
	backstory=(
		"You work at crewAI (https://crewai.com) and "
        " are now working on providing "
		"support to {customer}, a super important customer "
        " for your company."
		"You need to make sure that you provide the best support!"
		"Make sure to provide full complete answers, "
        " and make no assumptions."
	),
	allow_delegation=False,
	verbose=True
)

support_quality_assurance_agent = Agent(
	role="Support Quality Assurance Specialist",
	goal="Get recognition for providing the "
    "best support quality assurance in your team",
	backstory=(
		"You work at crewAI (https://crewai.com) and "
        "are now working with your team "
		"on a request from {customer} ensuring that "
        "the support representative is "
		"providing the best support possible.\n"
		"You need to make sure that the support representative "
        "is providing full"
		"complete answers, and make no assumptions."
	),
	verbose=True
)
```

support agent cannpot delegate its task, but the QA agent can delegate to the support agent.

        "Ensure that the answer is comprehensive, accurate, and adheres to the "
		"high-quality standards expected for customer support.\n"
        "Verify that all parts of the customer's inquiry "
        "have been addressed "
		"thoroughly, with a helpful and friendly tone.\n"
        "Check for references and sources used to "
        " find the information, "
		"ensuring the response is well-supported and "
        "leaves no questions unanswered."
    ),
    expected_output=(
        "A final, detailed, and informative response "
        "ready to be sent to the customer.\n"
        "This response should fully address the "
        "customer's inquiry, incorporating all "
		"relevant feedback and improvements.\n"
		"Don't be too formal, we are a chill and cool company "
	    "but maintain a professional and friendly tone throughout."
    ),
    agent=support_quality_assurance_agent,
)
```

QA review doesn't require any additional tools. 
Different Ways to Give Agents Tools:
- Agent Level: The Agent can use the Tool(s) on any Task it performs.
- Task Level: The Agent will only use the Tool(s) when performing that specific Task.

Note: Task Tools override the Agent Tools.

```python
crew = Crew(
  agents=[support_agent, support_quality_assurance_agent],
  tasks=[inquiry_resolution, quality_assurance_review],
  verbose=2,
  memory=True
)

Final Answer: 

Dear Andrew Ng from DeepLearningAI,

Thank you for reaching out with your inquiry about adding memory to your crew. To address your question, I have gathered information from the CrewAI documentation on setting up a Crew and kicking it off.

In the CrewAI framework, a Crew is an organization of AI agents with specialized roles, expertise, and goals. The CrewAI Crews are designed to optimize for autonomy and collaborative intelligence, enabling you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals. The Crew manages the overall operation, AI Agents work on their specialized tasks, the Process ensures smooth collaboration, and Tasks get completed to achieve the goal.

In terms of adding memory to your crew, you can equip your AI agents with custom tools and APIs to interact with external services and data sources. This will enable your agents to store and access memory as needed for their tasks. Additionally, you can define sequential or parallel workflows within the Crew, allowing agents to handle task dependencies and manage memory effectively.

Furthermore, the CrewAI framework also offers a structured workflow orchestration component called Flows. Flows provide granular control over workflow execution, ensuring tasks are executed reliably, securely, and efficiently. Flows integrate seamlessly with Crews, enabling you to balance high autonomy with exacting control over memory management.

In summary, to add memory to your crew in the CrewAI framework, you can equip your AI agents with custom tools and APIs for memory storage, define workflows to manage memory effectively, and utilize Flows for structured workflow orchestration. By leveraging these features, you can enhance the memory capabilities of your crew and improve their overall performance.

    verbose=True,
    backstory=(
        "Organized and detail-oriented, "
        "you ensure that every logistical aspect of the event "

    )
)
```

Create strongly types Pydantic classes
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
# Define a Pydantic model for venue details 
# (demonstrating Output as Pydantic)
class VenueDetails(BaseModel):
    name: str
    address: str
    capacity: int
    booking_status: str
```

- In the example below, it will run this hierarchically.
manager_llm lets you choose the "manager" LLM.

```python
from crewai import Crew, Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Define the crew with agents and tasks
financial_trading_crew = Crew(
    agents=[data_analyst_agent, 
            trading_strategy_agent, 
            execution_agent, 
            risk_management_agent],
    
    tasks=[data_analysis_task, 
           strategy_development_task, 
           execution_planning_task, 
           risk_assessment_task],
    
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
