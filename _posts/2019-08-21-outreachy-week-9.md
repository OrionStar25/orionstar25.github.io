2019 was an absolute blast for me and it isn't even over yet! I won a national-level hackathon, got good grades, completed TWO internships successfully, secured a job, attended my first technical conference, presented my Outreachy work in front of fellow Fedorans, gave a community talk and went to a foreign country without my parents(this one was my most commendable feat I think xD)! I have to admit I had been planning and trying out various options regarding my internships for over a year now. There were so many "things-should-go-this-way" timelines that I had created, and most of them were ultimately scraped off. But I can say confidently that things DID work out in the end and hardwork DID pay off and I am super grateful for that. 

So now since that huge phase of my life is over, let's start planning the NEXT BIG phase of my life! 

I'm currently in my last year of B.Tech. According to my university rules, the last semester(Jan-May) is reserved entirely for a project of 20 credits. I could do this project:

1. At a company as an industrial internship.
2. Under a professor as a research internship.
3. At my university as a research project.

I am still not sure what exactly I want to do career-wise but I have some very definite ideas of how I am going to figure that out. I've done an industrial internship at a startup. I've done a remote open-source internship, I've made several research projects under my university professors' guidance. So now its time for A RESEARCH INTERNSHIP! I'll keep the details very very brief(incase some potential professor sees this and wants to take me as an intern :') )
