Usually, ML interviews consist of case studies that require you to think about what features to use given a use-case. However, interviewers ocassionally also throw open-ended questions like - "How will you increase the functionality of our current product using AI/ML?". Thus, I had recently given a series of ML interviews for multiple e-commerce platforms and I did some pre-thinking before these interviews to prepare better. Below are a few ways I feel AI can be leveraged to improve the quality of e-commerce apps.


# Already happening ‚úÖ
	- Targetted ads
	- Personalized offers
	- Dynamic pricing
	- Recommendations for increased visibility
	- increased engagement


# Enhancements üìà

	- Rebalance driver fleets according to demand
		- followed by driver allocation
		- incentivize
		- lesser waiting times
		- greater coverage

	- augment customer service
		- automate flow with bots
		- provide solutions based on existing knowledge base (customer profiles, previous interactions, existing solutions)
		- greater autonomy to solve problems at care-tech level than engineer level
			- analysis entire order life-cycle to pin-point issue (stuck state, driver reblast)
		- use feedbacks to filter out complaints, suggestions and direct to relevant team
			- summarize pain points
			- provide initial problem suggestions

	- augment the app to a more human-like experience
		- "snacks for rainy day"
			- recommend food
				- individual items or set packages
			- provide customized offers (discount on existing cart, discount to add more items)
			- automatically add to cart, review, pay
		- "need ingredients to make biryani"
			- list products, or complete packages
		- promote (users+restos) based on festivals
		- create a mini-google within the app
			- "how much time form X to Y and whats the price"
			- review, book ride
		- spotify-like recommendations
			- "people also like"
			- "top 10 foods in your area"
			- "new releases"

	- have a unified cart with multiple restos (like amazon)
		- order pizza from dominos
		- chicken from kfc
		- pay all at once
		- internally calculate respective breakup and pay merchant

	- use AI for edge devices
		- "knowledge distillation," or ‚ÄúDomain reduction‚Äù, which involves training a smaller model to mimic the behavior of a larger model on a smaller data set
		- quantization to reduce memory footprint
		- hybrid solutions (cloud + edge)
			- with devices running ‚Äòlight‚Äô versions of the model for low latency while the cloud processes multiple tokens of the ‚Äòfull‚Äô model in parallel and corrects the device answers if needed.

	- Robustness
