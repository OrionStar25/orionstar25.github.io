The title is true. And I can prove it.


||Open Source Community| Neighbour|
|:-------|:-------:|-------:|
|1|The community is ever-growing now because of a plethora of awareness drives about OSS. You get to interact first hand with a variety of people on a greater variety of topics! Open source just doesn't involve coding. It also consists of documentations, designs, tech talks, student-friendly programmes, [community events](https://opensource.com/article/18/12/top-2019-conferences), [Hacktober Fest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and lots more, all heavily important for this community's healthy functioning. | They're the same old and probably wish you were gone.|
|----
|2|Every person's journey in Open Source starts with a community bonding session, where you talk cheerfully and proudly about yourself and get to know everyone else involved in your favourite project.   | Probably didn't even wish you on your birthday.|
|----
|3|OSS community is now engaging new contributors by organizing month-long programmes and provide handsome stipends. (GSoC)[https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/], (Outreachy)[https://www.outreachy.org/], (SOCIS)[https://socis.esa.int/], (GCI)[https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/], etc) | Neighbour giving you money? Good joke.|
|----
|4|You get to learn a lot of cool geeky concepts and are perceived as highly intellectual. You get to showoff organization [swag](https://twitter.com/StarOrion25/status/993495345471655937) and can attend OSS conferences around the world! |Probably bores you with the same abroad trip story and pics they took 2 yrs back.|

And all these realizations didn't come to me by *just* reading about them in blogs. I experienced it all firsthand. My journey hasn't been a straightforward one.

I had heard about GSoC during my 1st year of university, in a talk given by [Saptak Sengupta](https://twitter.com/Saptak013), a 4th year then, who was a GSoCer in FOSSASIA. Following his talk and reading various blogs online, I decided to apply for GSoC in my 2nd year when with some *magic googling*, I came across Outreachy. That year, I had applied with Mozilla for both the programs. I contributed to each project for [2 months](https://orionstar25.github.io/respec-my-interpretation/) but unfortunately wasn’t selected. Outreachy happens bi-yearly and so I applied again in December, only to get rejected due to ineligibility issues. By this time I wanted to be a part of an open source programme more than ever. With a lot of motivation from some of my friends, I decided to streamline my efforts and applied for Outreachy for the current round.

> **And here I am!**

I chose Outreachy over GSoC for a couple of reasons:

1. I can't be an Outreachy intern if I've been a GSoC intern previously(not applicable vice-a-versa).
2. While both the programmes promote awareness about opensource, Outreachy also hugley promoted diversity. This is something I strongly believe in and have been advocating it during my entire college life.
3. Its a little easier(can also say faster) to start contributing to an Outreachy project than a GSoc one. The codebase is generally intuitive, the pool of people applying is very focused, and mentors give greater attention to individuals.
4. And the stipend is a little too cool xD. We also get an additional $500 as trival stipend and I feel its such a brilliant way to engage people to explore and expand their physical boundaries!

## How to choose projects:

I can't stress this enough(and I wish I was told this earlier). 

> CHOOSE PROJECTS THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU, AND NOT BECAUSE YOUR FRIENDS ARE DOING THE SAME.

There is a huge amount of love for FOSSASIA in my university for some unknown reason. I too, following suit, *attempted* to contribute there. I failed miserably mainly because I wasn't comfortable with the tech stack and the projects just didn't speak to me. I also tried [TEAMMATES-NUS](http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/), [The Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/)and [Wikimedia](https://www.wikimedia.org/). I’m primarily an Ubuntu user and I love the control a terminal window gives me. I realized that I was more fluent in `C++/C` and `Python` than `JavaScript`, and that’s when I landed upon my project: `Extend unit tests for libmodulemd` (the project has changed now drastically, more about it [here](https://orionstar25.github.io/outreachy-week-2/)). While it eventually required me to triple boot my machine `(Windows + Ubuntu + Fedora)`, the intuitive code base and my mentor’s constant feedback made me passionate about contributing to Fedora.

I started with solving documentation issues, while other participants had started contributing to the actual codebase. After failing to run the project on a VM (**6 TIMES**), and triple booting it, I started tackling issues labelled as `Good-first-issue`. I would claim an issue and start working on it. Whenever I was stuck I would ask for doubts on Github and IRC. 

> In Outreachy, its more important to be consistent in your work than proficient.

Its one thing to practice Geeks For Geeks, sit for campus placements and get a job. But its completely another and noteworthy if you yourself initiate contributing to OSS. It takes guts. But as someone correctly said,

> Everything is difficult before its easy :-)
