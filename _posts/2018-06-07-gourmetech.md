Maybe its the topic that makes me want to write an entire blog about, but here you see an amalgamation of food(Gourmet) and technology(Tech) â€“ the 2 most widely loved entities of this century.

An enormous amount of credit goes to [Heston Blumenthal](http://www.thefatduck.co.uk/), aka, the Food Alchemist, for combining the former with latter and creating literal magic. My *extreme* favourites of his creations include:

1. **Nitro-poached mousse palate cleanser** 
He was the 1st chef to use liquid nitrogen in his dishes for instant freezing.

2. **Sound of the Sea**
This dish provides a multi-sensory approach. Seafood, kelp, seaweed and edible sand are plated to resemble the seashore and served alongside an iPod in a conch shell, which plays sounds of seagulls and the ocean waves.

But the reverse has been catching on too! Developers have managed to make their technologies and services more appealing by selling it as something weâ€™d like to dive in almost instantly.

### Its snack time

- Let me give you the most basic example:

- How about your favourite `CHIP`(s)?

- And while we are onto microprocessors, data units are termed as `nibble`, `bit`, `byte`â€¦. Whoaa.

- **Vegan** is an `npm` library that tells you whether a food item is vegan or not.

### Did anyone order dessert?

- Something for the sweet tooth :

- Following suit of these giants, weâ€™re seeing a number of tech startups turning to the grocery shelves for naming their ideas. From the dairy aisle, we have `Butter.ai`, a digital personal assistant, and `Cheddar`, an online financial news network that closed a $19 million round this week. Representing the produce section, thereâ€™s `Plum`, an online saving tool. And from the bakery, we have `Bagel Labs`, developer of a smart tape measure, and `Donut Media`, a startup targeting auto enthusiasts.

- Even blockchain caught up to this tasty deed and released [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/), [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/), and [Drizzle](http://truffleframework.com/docs/drizzle/getting-started). But the most exciting thing for me remains the [TruffleCon 2018](http://truffleframework.com/trufflecon2018)!

While the hunger for advanced technology remains a constant, our appetite for scrumptious food names is in equivalence! The point is: These ARE the exciting times we once hoped for. ðŸ˜€

Tell me about any quirky food-tech you've come across!
