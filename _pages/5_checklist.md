I've always had a dynamic checklist of things I want to do in life. However, I was inspired by [Chip Hyuen](https://huyenchip.com/list-100/) to officially list them down. This list is forever growing and I am looking forward to exciting external inputs (such as yours 🫵🏻) to extend it even further 📝.
