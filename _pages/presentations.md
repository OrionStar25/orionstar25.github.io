I enjoy delivering technical content in front of an audience. I feel it makes us all better learners and more receptive to critical feedback. Moreover, there is an increased sense of community that supports you lifelong ðŸ«‚! 

I frequently submit proposals to technical conferences globally. Below is a list of all my accepted presentations. Let's hope the list keeps growing over the years!
