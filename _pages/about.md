Welcome to my space üëãüèª! I am a postgraduate in Computing with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the National University of Singapore. 

My interests in the field of AI are diverse, ranging from Natural Language Processing, to applied data science, and robotics. However, I strongly believe that as AI becomes increasingly integrated into the lives of everyday consumers, it is paramount that we prioritize ethical considerations in our future model-building endeavors. Therefore, I am passionate about these multifaceted interdisciplinary challenges of building intelligent AI systems with a specific emphasis on enhancing robustness and fairness within them.

Previously, I finished my B.Tech in Information Technology from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad (IIIT-A), advised by <a href="https://profile.iiita.ac.in/opvyas/">Prof. O.P. Vyas</a>.

I am also an avid reader of books (fiction, adventure), love to sing, and engage in outdoor activities.
P.S. I am currently obsessed with watching live performances of several female artists. Here's my all-time favourite of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKm4YqadSGw'>Ariana Grande</a>.
