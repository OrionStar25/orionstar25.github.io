Welcome to my space üëãüèª! I am a postgraduate in Computing with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the <a href='https://scale.nus.edu.sg/programmes/graduate/master-of-computing/mcomp---artificial-intelligence-specialisation'>National University of Singapore</a>. 

My interests in the field of AI are diverse, ranging from <u>Natural Language Processing, to Applied Data Science, and Robotics</u>. However, I strongly believe that as AI becomes increasingly integrated into the lives of everyday consumers, it is paramount that we prioritize ethical considerations in our future model-building endeavors. Therefore, I am passionate about these multifaceted interdisciplinary challenges of building intelligent AI systems with a specific emphasis on <u>enhancing robustness and fairness</u> within them.

Previously, I finished my B.Tech in Information Technology from the <a href ='https://www.iiita.ac.in/'>Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad</a> (IIIT-A), advised by <a href="https://profile.iiita.ac.in/opvyas/">Prof. O.P. Vyas</a>.

I am also an avid reader of books (fiction, adventure), love to sing, and engage in outdoor activities. I am currently obsessed with watching live performances of female song artists. Here's my all-time favourite of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKm4YqadSGw'>Ariana Grande</a>.
