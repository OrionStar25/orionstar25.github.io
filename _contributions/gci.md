## About Google Code-In 

> Google Code-in was a contest that introduced pre-university students (ages 13-17) to open source software development. The contest was held for 10 years starting in November 2010 and wrapping up the final contest in January 2020.
>
> Google Code-in grew out of GHOP (The Google Highly Open Participation contest) which first took place back in 2007. The contest was reborn as Google Code-in during late 2010.
>
> Over 10 years, 63 open source mentoring organizations spent countless hours carefully creating tasks that were approachable for students who were new to both software development and specifically open source. Students were taught one of the most valuable lessons of all — everyone can contribute to open source software — you don’t have to be a coder to contribute. From documentation to research, training, design, outreach, quality assurance and coding there was something for any student interested in learning about this thing called open source.

## My involvement 👩🏻‍🏫

I was a mentor for [The Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org/) which was a participating open source organization in 2019. Specifically, I managed the [Fedora Modularity Project](https://github.com/fedora-modularity/libmodulemd/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+author%3AOrionStar25). The primary tech stack used and evaluated in this project was:
- Fedora tools
- Unit Testing
- Python
- Object C 
- Docker

My tasks involved mentoring pre-university students on:
- open-source issues
- bugs
- features
- community-driven development
- diversity for the Fedora Project.
