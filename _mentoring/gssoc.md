## My involvement 👩🏻‍🏫

I was a mentor for [She Endeavours](https://sheendeavors.org/) which was a participating open source organization in 2019. The objective was to mentor students to create a webiste for She Endeavors. The primary tech stack used and evaluated in this project was:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Git

My tasks involved mentoring university students on:
- open-source issues
- bugs
- features
- community-driven development
- diversity.
