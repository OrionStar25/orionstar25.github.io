The topics were mostly:</p> <ul> <li>How to be an open source contributor.</li> <li>How to utilise the existing women in STEM opportunities</li> <li>Mentoring on coding concepts.</li> </ul> <p>I learnt a lot via this process. In order to teach people something, you gotta be well-versed in it yourself. Therefore, providing mentoring to others pushed me to learn better, communicate better, and be accountable.</p> <p>These resources show my past mentorship activities:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://orionstar25.github.io/mentoring/">Events</a></li> <li><a href="https://orionstar25.github.io/presentations/">Talks</a></li> </ul> <p>However, now I needed mentorship. And it has been quite a journey to find what I was looking for.</p> <h1 id="why-do-i-seek-mentorship-">Why do I seek mentorship? 🧑🏻‍🏫</h1> <blockquote> <p>Why is it ALWAYS beneficial to have mentors in life? What can you expect to gain from a mentorship experience? How do you find good mentors?</p> </blockquote> <p>I recently graduated with a Masters degree in AI. I had previously worked in the industry as a Software Engineer and my experience was extremely enriching. However, I knew my true calling was to be associated with AI. So naturally, after graduation I was brimming with ideas about my career, my goals, opportunities I wanted to be a part of - and I couldn’t wait to join a company and get started!</p> <p>However, my plans came to a standstill (more like delayed) because I happened to graduate in the thick of mass tech layoffs globally and impending recession. Moreover, I was looking for highly speciliazed roles in the AI domain (such as deep learning, AI engineer roles) which had <em>just</em> started to gain popularity commercially, thereby rendering very few <em>actual</em> core AI jobs. And on top of that, even though I had applied to jobs in all major countries, I was unable to secure any interviews owing to requiring a sponsored work visa (all countries decided to restrict immigration at the same time 🫠). Finally, I turned to India for prospective jobs and I observed that majority of the companies in India either didn’t have highly specialised AI roles yet (used basic stats and ML to get by), or the offered salaries were lesser than my expectations.</p> <p>The struggle for those 4 months was real.</p> <p>The truth is:</p> <ol> <li> <p>AI is irrefutably up and coming. You can see it, I can see it, there is no denying it. We’re literally living the AI revolution right now.</p> </li> <li> <p>This automatically means that there <em>will</em> be a high demand for core AI skills in the future. I have already started seeing a slight surge in AI jobs albeit some restrictions<span style="color:blue">**</span>.</p> </li> <li> <p>However, currently the global industry is in a transitioning phase themselves. They’re riddled with recession and how to <em>use</em> AI for their usecase (or should they even?).</p> </li> <li> <p>And due to this reason, I see most companies requiring a minimum PhD for core AI entry-level jobs. They require an expert in the field to shape how AI can be used for the company ➡️ a completely reasonable requirement!</p> </li> <li> <p>However, it means I have the hardest time finding a good, well-suited job. The whole experience gave me a huge reality check of what it is like right now.</p> </li> </ol> <h1 id="the-process-">The Process ➿</h1> <p>Don’t get me wrong. I still have goals, just not a concrete direction at the moment. Therefore, considering my constant internal strife, I decided to seek external perspectives and their advice to learn from their experiences. With this motivation, I started to actively look for mentorship opportunities.</p> <p>I started with what I knew - googling and asking friends. However, after a few discussions it was evident that its not the best resource. On one hand, my friends are all around my age and figuring out life themselves. On the other, my family is too close to the issue. They start with an objective advice but then tend to show biases 🥲. For e.g.:</p> <ul> <li>“you should definitely think about pursuing a PhD. It has xyz benefits and you have the callibre for it.”</li> <li>“however, its a major time commitment and you gotta think about <em>other</em> things too”.</li> </ul> <p>😑 Yeah. No. Won’t work. Sorry.</p> <p>Hence, it was important I looked for someone who was firm and objective, with no biases, and would tell me exactly as it was. I personally believe, it is important to have mentors you can realistically look up to. Someone with whom you interact periodically and gain guidance from. Someone who has diverse experiences to share. I’m spelling this out for myself right now because at one point I thought I don’t really <em>need</em> mentors. I could just look up to great personas such as Elon Musk and try to follow in his footsteps. However, in hindsight, that is the most ridiculous thing ever. Elon’s work is admirable. But his circumstances were extraordinary and nothing like mine. I cannot possible read a few articles on his life story and make important career choices. It just wouldn’t translate. (maybe one day it might not be as ridiculous as today haha! 😏).</p> <p>I finally found a few leads!</p> <ol> <li> <p>I had been following the work of a Senior ML-engineer at Google for a month on LinkedIn and decided to reach out to them. They were exceptionally helpful, especially since they work in the thick of AI.</p> </li> <li> <p>I signed up on a website called <a href="https://www.vlookup.ai/">vLookUp</a> which is a platform to connect rising career women with prospective mentors. Via this, I got connected to a professional who has been in the industry for decades. They understood my worries and shared great stories about their experiences - how they witnessed the big Windows OS, SQL boom and how it was changing the landscape of tech at the time.</p> </li> <li> <p>I approached friends of my friends who have been current data scientists for a while and heard their stories (a lot of which were funny 😂).</p> </li> </ol> <p>My interactions with these people is still ongoing. I still have unresolved worries but I’m trying to take it one day at a time. I will continue to seek their advice over the next coming months. But I’m so happy that I’m a step closer than yesterday 💪🏻.</p> <p>Some other resources to look for potential mentors:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://topmate.io/">Topmate</a></li> <li><a href="https://mentorcruise.com/">MentorCruise</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.growthmentor.com/blog/online-mentoring-platforms-software/">Miscellaneous</a></li> </ul> <h1 id="some-self-introspection-️">Some Self-Introspection 🧘🏻‍♀️</h1> <p>Earlier at the start of this post, I said:</p> <blockquote> <p>And it has been quite a journey to find what I was looking for.</p> </blockquote> <p>Turns out, the journey was 95% about figuring out what <em>I wanted from life</em>, and only 5% finding the right people to guide me through it.</p> <p>I had to think long and hard about it - and somehow, it isn’t as easy as I had thought. For the longest time, I couldn’t answer the simple question: <em>“What do you want to do in life?”</em>. I suspect it was a series of things that made me this way:</p> <ul> <li> <p>I’ve been in a school setting for as long as I can remember. Everything is planned out, everything around you runs on a schedule. And you are expected to blindly follow it and excel in it. <strong>25 years of schooling.</strong> It obviously made me feel disoriented when this structured path was taken away from me. Now I was expected to create my own habits, my own routine, my own path - HOW FREAKIN SCARY! But also, in hindsight, how freaking nice. I get to choose.</p> </li> <li> <p>The world of tech I was familiar with had 2 specific roles: SWE and Data Scientist. I was the former and desperately wanted to be the latter. And just like that, this world transformed in a day rendering 10 different AI specific job titles with overlapping requirements, and somehow I was qualified to apply to all of them but still not enough to be considered for any. And the funniest thing is I am a Master’s graduate in AI. This <em>really</em> made me take a step back and re-evaluate life.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Every single day I learn more - about myself, about AI, about how to navigate tech. The key is to embrace and adapt, be consistent, and be present. If you don’t fit in any of the roles now, you don’t have to. I have finally realised that given the current circumstances, tech hiring is little based on skills and a lot on luck (+ strong referrals 😛).</p> <p>As for now, I’m forging my own path. I learn and re-learn and try to keep up. I’m just trying to be consistent haha.</p> <h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2> <p>This is an initial list of things I hope to achieve in the coming future:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Be more aware of the current trends in the industry. Specifically, precise trends, direction, and future prospects in the tech industry.</p> </li> <li> <p>Build connections for prospective career growth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Actively seek publick speaking opportunities. It makes me accountable and pushes my learning capabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be so much better at leetcode (lol I’m super average right now 🤪).</p> </li> <li> <p>Seek external collaborations with research labs. It’s exciting to stay in touch with R&amp;D, especially right now, with blazing fast AI developments happening every week.</p> </li> <li> <p>Look for roles in AI safety and build my skills accordingly.</p> </li> </ol> <hr/> <p><em>Fin.</em></p> <p><strong>P.S.:</strong> This post will be updated as I get new insights. It’s still a WIP because I’m still a WIP 🙂.</p> <p><span style="color:blue">**This in itself presents a plethora of interesting challenges and I plan to write a blog post dedicated to just this very soon.</span></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="industry"/><category term="mentoring"/><category term="experience"/><category term="opportunities"/><category term="artificial intelligence"/><category term="career"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I pen down my experiences of finding mentors to help me navigate commom industry challenges]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fedora Women’s Day 2019</title><link href="https://orionstar25.github.io/blog/2019/fwd-19/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fedora Women’s Day 2019"/><published>2019-11-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://orionstar25.github.io/blog/2019/fwd-19</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://orionstar25.github.io/blog/2019/fwd-19/"><![CDATA[<p>On 4th November, 2019 we celebrated <strong>Fedora Women’s Day</strong> at IIIT Allahabad. I, alongwith <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aadya.mishra.583">Aadya Mishra</a> co-organized this event for an audience mainly consisting of first and second year girls, pursuing either Information Technology or Electronics and Communication. Everyone had a basic grasp on simple coding concepts, but after interacting with them it was clear that very few knew about the various opportunities girls have in the technology field and open source. Hence, I decided to take this opportunity to explain to these budding minds how much fun and full of possibilities it is to be a <strong>#WomanInTech</strong>.</p> <p>In order to start preparations for this event, we decided to have an attractive poster. Our obvious choice for its design was another talented woman, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sunidhi.kashyap.5283">Sunidhi Kashyap</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Fedora Women’s Day (FWD) is a day of celebration to help raise awareness and thanks for the women contributors across the Fedora Project. Fedora Women’s Day marks the anniversary of the Fedora Women team. They are an opportunity for women to learn about free and open source software and jump-start their journey as a FOSS user and/or a contributor.</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>We have a series of fun events lined-up for all of you including:</strong> <strong>~ Mini games</strong> <strong>~ Hands-on session on how to start contributing to Fedora</strong> <strong>~ Learn to deliver talks in conferences</strong> <strong>~ Fedora opportunities and networking</strong> <strong>~ FOOD and SWAG!</strong> <strong>~ and much, much more</strong></p> </blockquote> <p><img src="http://tiny.cc/omoyfz" alt=""/></p> <p>My entire aim was to use this session to motivate these girls enough to understand their options in the field of computer science and its associated technology. Hence I created an extensive 2-hour session revolving around such topics.</p> <p>I started by introducing the <strong>Fedora DI Team</strong> and its role in nurturing inclusive events across the Fedora community and raising awareness about diversity around the globe. I explained how one can be a part of the DI team and still be called an open source contributor. Next I explained what open source means and what all Fedora offers in the community. This was followed by an interactive game where everyone were to name 5 OSS they’ve used in their lives till now.</p> <p>I then moved on to explain the various coding programmes Fedora is part of, namely, <strong>Outreachy and GSoC</strong>. I gave an overview of:</p> <ol> <li>Each programs’ purpose and perks.</li> <li>How one can benefit with the constant mentorship and</li> <li>How inclusive and welcoming Fedora is to its beginner contributors.</li> </ol> <p>I shared my Outreachy and Flock experience, and they seemed absolutely thrilled to be a part of something so empowering. Since most of the girls’ main worry was that whether they were good enough to contribute, I gave real coding examples from my Outreachy selection process so that they knew what kind of open-source issues to expect (and that they were absolutely easy to solve).</p> <p>After I had gotten them all bustling with enthusiasm and hope, I introduced them to the Women of Fedora by showing a short video. This was followed by addressing the elephant in the room: <strong>Imposter Syndrome</strong>. They were all made to understand that they’re all much more talented than they give themselves credit for. To implement this, we had a quick <strong>#IAmRemarkable</strong> session, inspired by Google wherein each girl spoke about 5 achievements of her. It made them realize they’re all full of potential.</p> <p>I then bombarded them with a whole lot of links about scholarships, conferences, and funded speaking opportunites so that they could discover their passion in their university life by networking and exploring various fileds. Since majority of the audience consisted of first years, I gave them tips as to how can they make productive use of their winter and summer break.</p> <p>The extensive session ended with feedback, general brainstorming, and was peppered with tasty refreshments. Every girl left with a lot to think about and the atmosphere was heavily postive and encouraging. I couldnt’t be more proud sharing my knowledge with these aspirants.

I was finishing tasks as and when they came, was meeting new people almost everyday, all while away in a new city….</p> <blockquote> <p>But the moment I used to open <a href="https://github.com/fedora-modularity/libmodulemd">libmodulemd’s</a> Github and log into IRC, I felt at home.</p> </blockquote> <p>I started as a self doubting kid and I’m going away as a confident, full-of-dreams kid. Outreachy has made me CAPABLE. I no longer use clip-on wings, because I’ve grown a pair (and that too very shiny ones)! There are a lot of Open Source programs out there, but NONE of them compare to Outreachy for me. Not even GSoC. Every single thing I did in this internship was purely out of passion and the will to get better holistically. I <em>wanted</em> to write blogs, chat with mentors, learn new technology, and network with people.</p> <p>AND OUTREACHY MADE SURE I DID. They:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sent regular bi-weekly email prompts to write blogs which also provided fantastic topics + tips to write blogs on.</p> </li> <li> <p>Had assignments for mentors too! They DEFINITELY wanted us to fully squeeze this opportunity and enable us in every way possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Held regular Outreachy chats including all participants, mentors, and alumni on topics like: career, project progress, making connections, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>I recently heard someone stating that GSoC is where all the “real talent” is, and Outreachy is mere “spoon-feeding”. Yes, I’ve had my mentor walk me through some really tough roadblocks, and yes he has reviewed my code thoroughly at all times. But THAT’S NOT SPOON-FEEDING. That’s just good mentorship (thank you, Sir!). Outreachy projects are perfect for 3-month internships! They’re a right balance of researching and implementation. <strong>And FYI, MANY Outreachy projects are ALSO GSoC projects WITH THE SAME SET OF MENTORS!</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, provide a $500 travel stipend that you could use for conferences and tech events.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I’ll admit I was quite apprehensive how I could possibly manage to dole out “significant” code when I had absolutely no internship experience before. I thought I’d have to work day and night because the concept of a “remote” internship was new to me. Thankfully, Outreachy was super flexible and not hectic at all! I used a MAMMOTH amount of concepts:</p> <ol> <li>Object C</li> <li>Unit testing in Python and Object C</li> <li>Dockers</li> <li>Still learning <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html">Python Mocks</a> 😜</li> <li>Git Rebase!! (This one was amazing xD)</li> <li>Python Babel</li> <li>Fedora tools like Modularity, Zanata, Koji Builds</li> <li>IRC 😂</li> </ol> <p>My project was divided into 3 major tasks and 1 stretch goal. And I can proudly say that <strong>I have completed all the 3 major tasks during my internship period!</strong> The library <a href="https://github.com/fedora-modularity/ModulemdTranslationHelpers">“Modulemd Translation Helpers”</a> is fully functional but just needs a little extra push to make it deployable. I:</p> <ol> <li>Converted a Modulemd Index object into Babel Catalogs.</li> <li>Converted translated Catalogs to translation documents and added them back to Index object.</li> <li>Integrated the Koji Build System for dynamic flow of metadata</li> </ol> <p>Now we’re only left to inject this new index object metadata into existing YAML by the use of an OS compose tool called Pungi. Hence then these translations will be avalaible to all Fedora users!</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Still, the MOST AMAZING thing that has happened with me during this internship was my visit to Flock to Fedora at Budapest, Hungary and present all of this work as part of the Summer Coding Showcase.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>I met my mentor <a href="https://twitter.com/sgallagh_redhat">Stephan Gallagher</a> and we chatted on almost everything! I met people from Panama, Czech Republic, Mexico, USA, India (obviously :P), China, Nicaragua and so many more and I discussed everything that happens there and how its different than my culture. We talked tech and how we could improve it further for people, not just pertaining to Red Hat or Fedora. I attended so many talks and workshops related to Translations, Internationalization (I20N), Modularity, and Red Hat. I also witnessed a MIND_BLOWING CANDY SWAP where people got different kinds of candies from their countries!</p> <p>Just when you thought you couldn’t possibly do EVERYTHING in 3 months, WELL I JUST DID! It’s time to move further and take these experiences with me. Its time to make those shiny wings multi-coloured 🌞</p> <p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=0B6ForE8OhMdTWkVkVXJVRkxFOXFhSmdURmVNX2pTTjc2cmFZ" alt="Yay"/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="open-source"/><category term="open source"/><category term="outreachy"/><category term="technology"/><category term="gsoc"/><category term="research"/><category term="python"/><category term="jekyll"/><category term="modularity"/><category term="fedora"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bye bye Outreachy, thank you for making me capable 💓]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What now? #CareerGoals</title><link href="https://orionstar25.github.io/blog/2019/outreachy-week-9/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What now? #CareerGoals"/><published>2019-08-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-08-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://orionstar25.github.io/blog/2019/outreachy-week-9</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://orionstar25.github.io/blog/2019/outreachy-week-9/"><![CDATA[<p>2019 was an absolute blast for me and it isn’t even over yet! I won a national-level hackathon, got good grades, completed TWO internships successfully, secured a job, attended my first technical conference, presented my Outreachy work in front of fellow Fedorans, gave a community talk and went to a foreign country without my parents(this one was my most commendable feat I think xD)! I have to admit I had been planning and trying out various options regarding my internships for over a year now. There were so many “things-should-go-this-way” timelines that I had created, and most of them were ultimately scraped off. But I can say confidently that things DID work out in the end and hardwork DID pay off and I am super grateful for that.</p> <p>So now since that huge phase of my life is over, let’s start planning the NEXT BIG phase of my life!</p> <p>I’m currently in my last year of B.Tech. According to my university rules, the last semester(Jan-May) is reserved entirely for a project of 20 credits. I could do this project:</p> <ol> <li>At a company as an industrial internship.</li> <li>Under a professor as a research internship.</li> <li>At my university as a research project.</li> </ol> <p>I am still not sure what exactly I want to do career-wise but I have some very definite ideas of how I am going to figure that out. I’ve done an industrial internship at a startup. I’ve done a remote open-source internship, I’ve made several research projects under my university professors’ guidance. So now its time for A RESEARCH INTERNSHIP! I’ll keep the details very very brief(incase some potential professor sees this and wants to take me as an intern :’) )</p> <ul> <li>Are you looking for a job, internship, a grant, a volunteer position, or some type of other opportunity?</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Research internship abroad at a reputed university under a professor.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>What types of work would you like to contribute to?</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Research pertaining to:</p> <ol> <li>Machine learning and/or</li> <li>Deep learning and/or</li> <li>Natural Language Processing</li> </ol> </blockquote> <ul> <li>What tools or skills do you have that would help you with that work?</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>I have 4 major projects done in that domain:</p> <ol> <li>2 in Natural Language Processing</li> <li>1 in Ensemble Learning</li> <li>1 in attention-based convolutional recurrent network <strong>all graded A+ as part of semester-long projects</strong> I am fluent with python and ML concepts, and can implement all algorithms with/without using existing frameworks.

It’s <strong>Open Source Summer</strong> coding season at <strong>The Fedora Project</strong>. Translations are pouring heavily at <strong>Modularity</strong>, a strong gust of <strong>Happiness Packets</strong> are incoming in from the East, <strong>Fedora pipelines</strong> are being modified to handle the frequent Fedora releases.</p> <p>I’m VERY excited to be writing this blog post. I have essentially only a month left for my Outreachy internsip with The Fedora Project to end. Surprisingly, this realization is of a bitter-sweet one. The amount of skills I’ve picked up during my 2 months of Outreachy are simply priceless. I not only tried to code within deadlines, but also learnt new concepts and technology, implemeted it to reflect into my code, networked with different people as part of fedora community bonding, made MAJOR mistakes, tried to redeem myself from them (still working on that 🙈), and I’m DEFINITELY not done just yet!</p> <h2 id="my-optimististic-timelines-">My Optimististic timelines 😂</h2> <p>Outreachy mentors and interns start the internship with a specific set of project goals. These timelines are ususally a very optimistic view of what could happen if everything goes exactly as planned. IT OFTEN DOESN’T, but people still make optimistic plans. This concept is called as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy">Planning Fallacy</a>. Projects always feel easy to work on initially. But delays to projects happen. Maybe your project turned out to be more complicated than you or your mentor anticipated. Maybe you needed to learn some concepts before you could tackle project tasks. Maybe the community documention wasn’t up-to-date or was wrong.</p> <p>Keeping all this in mind, this was my initial timeline:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>May 20, 2019 - May 25, 2019</strong> - Shall participate via community bonding. Will continuously be in touch with the mentor to break down the internship tasks into steps for the coming days. Will go through the code base thoroughly to look for vulnerabilities, potential bugs, and redundancies.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>May 26, 2019 - June 10, 2019</strong> - Implement any test that exists only in Python, in C, to ensure that they are getting properly tested by the static analysis and memory-leak checkers (valgrind). This would essentially involve copying already written python tests to C.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>June 11, 2019 - July 10, 2019</strong> - Write code for a set of new tests which will be provided by the mentor.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>July 11, 2019 - Aug 11, 2019</strong> - Scan the library for any leftover tests, or vulnerabilities. Write exhaustive unit tests for the leftover code blocks and extend some already written tests (if necessary). Try to make the tests modular by breaking them into smaller tests for maintainability.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>Aug. 12, 2019 - Aug. 20, 2019</strong> - Update documentation for all the changes made during the internship.</p> </blockquote> <p>And then my project changed completely. This time, my mentor made my new timeline:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Phase 1</strong>: Extract all translatable strings from the modules that have been built for each Fedora release and submit them to the translation tool, Zanata, for the translators to work on.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Retrieve the finished translations and use the libmodulemd API to turn them into modulemd-translations documents.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>Stretch Goal</strong>: Include the code from Phase 2 into Fedora’s repo creation automation so that it gets updated automatically every day.</p> </blockquote> <p><img src="../assets/img/lifecycle_translation.png" alt="Translation Lifecycle"/></p> <p>I must say this timeline seemed very relaxed and exciting to me. This project felt like I was a consumer AND a developer for libmodulemd both at the same time.</p> <h2 id="project-flow">Project flow</h2> <p>Now that my project was broken down into tasks, I had to understand each of these problems thoroughly and break them into smaller tasks. That way, I could create a workflow and convert it into modular code. For any task I undertook, I was expected to:</p> <ol> <li>Discuss the goal of that task and do theoritical study on the required concepts.</li> <li>Write a requirements document stating: <ol> <li>All the constraints.</li> <li>Expected input/output.</li> <li>Dependencies needed(if any).</li> <li>Activity flowchart described into words</li> </ol> </li> <li>Write unit tests first for the task validating our expectation of the workflow. This is called <a href="https://www.guru99.com/test-driven-development.html">Test-Driven Development</a>.</li> <li>Finally write code and fix any intermediary bugs or add necessary features on the way.</li> <li>Ask doubts throughout, if stuck.</li> </ol> <p>Here is an extract of a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document for my first task. You can check out the whole document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FANPQE1qwpIjgYGIDGxNH5pOcQ4VMq9O0Xy9Ie0t_ZM/edit?ts=5ce6e6f5">here</a>.</p> <p><img src="../assets/img/SRS.png" alt="SRS Document"/></p> <h2 id="task-1">Task 1</h2> <blockquote> <p>Extract all translatable strings from the modules that have been built for each Fedora release and submit them to the translation tool, Zanata, for the translators to work on.</p> </blockquote> <p><img src="../assets/img/phase1.png" alt="Phase 1"/></p> <h3 id="extraction">Extraction</h3> <ol> <li>Fedora modular metadata is divided into modules which are stored as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YAML</code> files.</li> <li>Every <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YAML</code> file is loaded into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ModulemdIndex</code> object.</li> <li>Each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ModulemdIndex</code> object contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ModulemdModule</code> objects.</li> <li>Each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ModulemdModule</code> object contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ModulemdModuleStream</code> objects.</li> <li>Each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ModulemdModuleStream</code> (identified by their <a href="https://orionstar25.github.io/outreachy-week-2/">NSVCA</a>) object contains 3 translatable strings: <ol> <li>Summary</li> <li>Description</li> <li>Profile description (There may be zero or more profiles. Each profile may have a description and an arbitrary profile name.)</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>We stored all the strings of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">module:stream</code> pair that were only of the <strong>highest</strong> version. It is acceptable to assume that if there are multiple matching <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">streams</code> of the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">module</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stream</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">version</code> but different <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">context</code> and/or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">architecture</code> that you do not need to care about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">context</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">architecture</code>.

It accepts <a href="http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/messages/catalog.html">Babel Catalogs</a> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gettext .pot</code> files) containing unique strings in one language as keys along with their locations of occurrences in the file. All these strings need to be unique in the catalog. This is important because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gettext .pot</code> files cannot handle having the same source string appear more than once. These catalogs are further processed into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.po</code> (portable object) files and forwarded for translation. Locations are of the type:</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">module_name</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">stream_name</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">string_type</span>

Now we would pull actual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YAMLs</code> from fedora’s repo creation tool, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Koji</code>, and then apply the process to obtain translations. I have created a CLI Tool so that individual release translations can be manually added to their respective <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modulemd YAML</code> metadata. But to include these translations into the main release is still a work-in-progress.</p> <p>As of now, I’m a maintainer for the Modulemd Translation Helpers repository for Fedora.

GoJek’s candidate selection process had a stark difference from every other company that came to the campus:</p> <ol> <li>Shortlist candidates on the basis of <strong>open source contributions</strong> and/or major projects built apart from coursework.</li> <li>A <strong>code-pairing round</strong>: We were paired with a mentor from GoJek and given a highschool level application to build in a span of 2 hours.</li> <li>Technical interview</li> <li>HR interview</li> </ol> <p>When you’re weighing your options for a summer internship, it’s easy to gravitate toward a big-name company. But there’s a lot to be gained by working for a startup, especially when you’re first making your entrance into the workforce. My internship started in the summer of 2019 on May 27th. <strong>I worked on two different projects pertaining to two different tech stacks in a span of two months.</strong> That’s how crazy my learning curve was!</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*EqK0CSTnQhBAVAZOIbqFdg.jpeg" alt="startup"/></p> <h4 id="two-minds-are-better-than-one">Two minds are better than one!</h4> <p>In GoJek, we heavily depend on <strong>pair-programming</strong>. Throughout my internship, I have paired various times with my fellow interns which has only resulted in much faster and robust results. My first project was to add features to a slackbot, called <strong>GoBot</strong>. This bot was aimed at increasing the developer efficiency of Gojek by automating the on-boarding process of a new GoJek joinee. We added functionalities such as:</p> <ol> <li>Invite users to team-specific channels.</li> <li>Give <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">knightswatch</code> access for various services to individuals based on their team and role.</li> </ol> <p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1bFD9kC0NXB3ELdav6X4XgFEZObPFub4c" alt="gobot"/></p> <p>We also planned to integrate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PagerDuty</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">New Relic</code> with GoBot but unfortunately couldn’t due to authorization and access issues. This project, hence was completed in about 3.5 weeks. I got to learn about Golang (language in which the bot is written), unit testing, network servers, curl requests, and REST APIs.</p> <p>After this, we started work on our second project <strong>Go-Triage</strong>. GoJek’s recruitement process consists of two stages:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Code triaging</strong>: A basic hygiene check validating that the submission is in accordance with GoJek standard.</li> <li><strong>Code review</strong>: GoJek developers review the code and shortlist candidates for interview.</li> </ol> <p>The triaging process has been fairly manual up till now. Recruiters check for various parameters in a submission and forward it to the developers if all checks pass. Otherwise they contact the candidate via email to correct their solution and submit again. Hence, we built a portal to automate the triaging process!</p> <ol> <li>Select a compressed file(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zip</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tar</code>) to submit.</li> <li>Select the language of your submission.</li> <li>Click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upload</code>, sit back, and relax!</li> </ol> <p>Our code inspects and runs the submission in the given language, and finally produces a triage report stating what all checks have passed and failed. Therefore, a to-and-fro process which once took about 2-3 weeks to complete, now finishes in a matter of 3 mouse clicks! Since we built this project from scratch, it gave us maximum flexibility to experiment with possibilities. There were 4 iterations to this project:</p> <ol> <li><strong>V1:</strong> Build a CLI tool to automate the triage process.</li> <li><strong>V2:</strong> Pull language-specific dockers that will create a container environment for each submission to run in.</li> </ol> <p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1AIzB9ZgWslqRpbnItDR2VZrFUsnBHQZw" alt="cli"/></p> <ol> <li><strong>V3:</strong> Build a frontend dashboard that will help the recruiters use our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">V2</code> CLI tool with ease. That way, they will just have to send the summary table back to the candidates.</li> </ol> <p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1pUgyt-kJe_1ynIAkZagOK0eNkcFNpQB8" alt="frontend"/></p> <ol> <li><strong>V4:</strong> Deploy the portal on a public IP so that candidates can use it themselves and get instant feedback. This meant better UI, authorization to prevent malicious submissions, and not jeopardise GoJek’s entire system 🙂</li> </ol> <p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1e5ZsmB26P_FUUxfvB67nisNUAJ92GbUG" alt="new"/></p> <p>I learnt about Ruby (main language for our backend), test-driven development, Dockers, Nodejs, and Bootstrap. The technical curve for both the project was high. Along the way, we also learnt valuable lessons such as not to get too “bound” to your code. You’ll probably write more efficient code in the second iteration anyway. There was heavy usage of version control (which I love), and as our tech lead said once:</p> <blockquote> <p>These projects have low risk and high impact!</p> </blockquote> <p>Needless to say, I’m very proud of our end product. 😍</p> <h4 id="culturally-fit--gojek">Culturally-fit @ GoJek</h4> <p>GoJek <em>really</em> likes to take care of their employees (even interns). We were spoilt heavily for these 2 months and we just couldn’t say no! My to-and-fro flights, accommodation and food were all paid and taken care of for the entire duration of my internship by GoJek. We were also given a Macbook Pro upon arrival.</p> <p>As an intern for a large company, your exposure is often limited to the small portion that you’re working on directly. With hundreds of interns and thousands of employees, there’s no way to effectively expose yourself to all aspects of the business. But in GoJek, it’s almost impossible not to. Our projects required us to go beyond our 3-member team so frequently, the amount of exposure and awareness we received was precious.</p> <ol> <li>The <strong>Go-Food</strong> team was our go-to for any doubts regarding integration, code structures, dockers, etc.</li> <li>We sat with the <strong>recruiters</strong> to understand our problem statement for Go-Triage better.</li> <li>We were aquainted with team <strong>Magneto</strong> who were working on another recruitment based problem and discussed their approach.</li> <li>We collaborated with the <strong>Design</strong> team for our frontend.</li> <li>Finally, we had long sessions with the <strong>Security</strong> team to make our project robust and remove vulnerabilities.</li> </ol> <h5 id="design-team-working-on-rebranding-of-the-gojek-logo"><em>Design team working on rebranding of the GoJek logo</em></h5> <p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1y4n78wkv6g2bvhYkXRd05KiKTHUfnLEk" alt="Design Team"/></p> <p>Hence, somewhere in between regular cafeteria journeys, team outings, movie nights, awesome lunches, foosball tournaments, stickers, swags, flexible working hours, great office vibes, daily standups, numerous induction sessions, all-hands sessions, demos, open source collaborations …… (ah, the list is wayy too long!)

Do you also feel completely indispensible by using “Incognito Mode” while internet surfing? Sadly, you’re still not as “anonymous” as you thought.</p> <p>The incognito mode allows receiving “anonymous” cookies that cannot be linked to one’s identity. However, if one logs back into Google before leaving Incognito Mode, Google will be able to retroactively link their browsing data to their account. This works by taking the previously anonymous cookies and then associating them with their Google account.</p> <p>That’s where comes the Dark Web. And its NOT the same as the Deep Web.</p> <p><img src="https://stardiariesweb.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/dark-web.jpg" alt="darkweb"/></p> <p><a href="https://encyclopediadramatica.se/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=400213&amp;title=Deep_web">Deep Web</a> is simply the content of databases and other web services that cannot be indexed by conventional search engines. Whereas <a href="https://encyclopediadramatica.se/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=400213&amp;title=Deep_web">Dark Web</a> is an encrypted network that exists between <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview">Tor (formerly known as The Onion Router)</a> servers and their clients. Using Tor’s software makes it difficult, if not impossible, for any snoops to see your web mail, search history or other online activities. Your traffic is routed from your computer and through an onion-like layer of servers. Furthermore, the IP addresses of darknet services are hidden so that their hosts cannot be traced. This can proves highly useful for journalists, activists and business people.</p> <p><img src="https://media.springernature.com/original/springer-static/image/chp%3A10.1007%2F978-3-030-01659-3_45/MediaObjects/471865_1_En_45_Fig2_HTML.png" alt="Tor"/></p> <p>The dark web holds everything sweet and sour. Many websites in the deep web are not legal to visit (child pornography, snuff films, torture flicks, etc.). These websites often change addresses frequently and require massive effort in order to find them. Because of the nature of these websites, their visitors are monitored. Although law enforcement may do their best to have these websites shut down, the deep web is under no legal jurisdiction (hence, the reason for the deep web’s existence). The largest darknet market remains the The Silk Road 3.0, the ‘eBay of drugs’ being an anonymous platform for selling illegal drugs. What sustains these markets’ existence is – <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">BITCOINS</a>. <strong>Bitcoin</strong> is both a crypto-currency and an electronic payment system invented by an unidentified programmer, or group of programmers, under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. But here’s the catch! It’s value is highly dynamic in nature, or as experts like to say- a bubble.</p> <p><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XNTCtEiPrvU/WS48N716KnI/AAAAAAAAMFY/-imLxGYUNF01l6gR4WOo6CpVLBR5IYkKACLcB/s1600/bitcoin%2Bdynamic%2Bequilibrium%2B1.png" alt="Bitcoin"/></p> <p>In conclusion, even if your purpose of using the dark web is purely curiosity, you’re a lot more in danger than not. Get ready to come across real drug dealers, satanic cults, hitmans for takeaways, and people selling just carrots only to earn some bitcoins! Here are a list of links that will help you find interesting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.onion</code> URLs:-</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://thehiddenwiki.org/">Hidden Wiki: Tor .onion urls directories</a></li> <li><a href="http://the-hidden-wiki.com/">HiddenWiki Deep Web Links</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/2mxqdp/the_uncensored_hidden_wiki_is_up/">The uncensored hidden wiki is up</a></li> </ul> <p>But again, the deep web is not a tourist place. Stay anonymous, stay safe.</p> <p>P.S.: Some real-life darkweb experiences:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>“I downloaded TOR and within 20 minutes of downloading it and browsing random crap I got a phone call but there was no one there and they just hung up after 10 seconds. I didn’t even know if it was legal at the time so that was enough to freak me out and I stopped right there.”</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>Silk Road. Circa 2013.
